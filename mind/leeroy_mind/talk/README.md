# Optional typing cadence

`[talk] realism = true` enables bounded cadence for generated typed member turns.
The default is false; a malformed value or unknown talk key leaves this feature off.
Templates, signed text, raid callouts, urgent turns, hotmic and external transports
keep their existing timing. This does not change prompts or voice delivery.

The speed prior uses the persona's typing habit, authored age and a stable guid seed.
A measured numeric voice fingerprint can adjust it slightly; a seeded fingerprint
does not count as measured speed. These are authored cadence choices, not measured
keystrokes or claims about real demographic groups. Speed stays within 25–100 WPM.
Length, jitter, long-reply thinking time and small inter-line gaps determine the wait.
The existing typing dots refresh at least every ten seconds throughout it.

An optional natural-clause burst has at most three lines and a ninety-second
per-member cooldown. Combat and wipe silence/debrief suppress it. Rare corrections
use six reviewed adjacent-key nonwords, protect character/owner names and skip
links and mentions. Existing random styler typos are disabled on these turns. A
member earns at most one correction per fifty confirmed normal lines; a two-percent
random chance and the allowance both have to pass. A correction reserves its
allowance before waiting and cannot earn allowance itself. Restart/eviction resets
allowance to zero. No content is stored for this accounting.

The `*word` correction follows the acknowledged typo by 5–10 seconds, through the
ordinary transport and rate checks. If the member becomes AFK, offline, invalid or
in combat, or the turn is cancelled, the correction is abandoned. It is never
queued for later. The original correctly spelled words remain the repeat/history
input. A burst and a correction together never exceed three lines.

All new waits, including thinking, gaps and a possible correction, share a budget:
at most twelve extra seconds for a whisper/DM, thirty for other typed channels,
relative to the original typing formula for the styled turn. The ordinary first-line
deadline can shorten this further. Existing send-lock contention and bridge ACK
latency are outside this typing budget and are unchanged.

Game-busy evidence uses only native reports: boss participants, current dungeon/
raid map and a zone transition within twenty seconds. There is no new probe and no
claim to observe generic combat, movement or taxi state. A busy game whisper gets a
small pause and only its first complete styled line. Discord never inherits game
busy/AFK delays or advances game activity. Its enabled cadence may turn a long
message into separate short posts, still in the same channel/thread or DM pair.

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_timing_realism.py` for the fake-clock checks.
